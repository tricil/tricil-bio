John Jacobus from Atlanta, GA has released a handful of cross-pollinated solo EP’s since 1998 under the name <a href="https://plus.google.com/114582410258657650699" rel="me"></a>TRICIL. TRICIL has always been a genre blurring project, mainly sticking to melodic IDM with harsh industrial and slight dubstep and electro flourishes. A guitarist at heart, many TRICIL songs, such as <a href="http://tricil.net/emancipation">The Emancipation</a>, take their origin on the guitar before being translated in to the electronic realm.

Accolades include playing live keyboards for German electronic act Haujobb in 2007, as well as contributing to their 2011 comeback opus - <a href="http://tricil.net/haujobb-new-world-march-out-now-listen-to-control-here/">New World March</a>, doing Ableton Live programming for Goodie Mob in early 2010, and one time getting on stage with Pigface to sing "Suck" and "Supernaut" on Thanksgiving 2001. Other credits include two Nerd Parade albums and tours, a full length with The Secret Life and remixes for Celldweller, <a href="http://tricil.net/htda-rmx">How to Destroy Angels</a>, <a href="http://tricil.net/architect-the-shadows-of-eve-tricil-remix-out-now-on-hymen-records/">Architect</a>, and Haujobb.

In 2010, TRICIL released <strong>The Emancipation</strong> on Clear Notice Records garnering <a href="http://tricil.net/the-emancipation-is-on-hype-machine/">Hype Machine</a> recognition and a critically acclaimed, multiple award-winning <a href="http://tricil.net/video/">music video</a> released via unique iPad application.

In 2011, TRICIL contributed to Haujobb's first new album in eight years, New World March.

<blockquote><p>This man’s production is unlike anything I have ever heard. Glitchy, yet arranged. Murky, yet crisp. And given the sound of everything I have heard in his hometown of Atlanta, it makes no sense to me.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some people would pigeon hole Tricil into the rather generic "Electronica" category, some would label it as being "Leftfield", another term I don't really like. I would describe Tricil's sounds as being Experimental, which I think gives a more accurate and descriptive term of the music he produces and if you listen to his tracks I'm sure you'll see where I'm coming from. When I listen through his tracks what strikes me is the pushing of boundaries.</p>
